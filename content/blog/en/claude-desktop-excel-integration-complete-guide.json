  "content": "# Claude Desktop Meets Excel: Your AI Spreadsheet Assistant Is Here\n\nImagine having Claude as your personal Excel assistant - one that can instantly run complex calculations, analyze scenarios, and answer questions about your data. But here's the twist: Claude never sees your actual spreadsheet, formulas, or sensitive information.\n\nThat's exactly what SpreadAPI's MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration delivers. For more details, [learn more about the MCP protocol](/blog/mcp-protocol-excel-developers-guide). In this guide, we'll show you how to transform Claude Desktop into a powerful spreadsheet companion in just 5 minutes.\n\n## Why Claude Desktop + Excel Is a Game-Changer\n\nTraditional AI-spreadsheet integrations ([Excel API without file uploads](/blog/excel-api-without-uploads-complete-guide)) force you to choose between functionality and security:\n\n**Upload your entire file?** Your formulas and data are exposed\n**Share via cloud storage?** Persistent access risks\n**Copy-paste data?** Manual, error-prone, and time-consuming\n**Rebuild in code?** Why duplicate what Excel already does perfectly?\n\nWith SpreadAPI's MCP integration, Claude can:\n\n✅ **Run calculations** using your Excel models  \n✅ **Answer questions** about your data  \n✅ **Perform what-if analysis** on different scenarios  \n✅ **Generate reports** based on live calculations  \n\nAll while your Excel files remain completely private and secure.\n\n## Real-World Magic: What You Can Build\n\n### Financial Advisory Assistant\n\n**You:** \"Claude, what's the monthly payment for a $450,000 mortgage at 6.5% for 30 years?\"\n\n**Claude:** \"I'll calculate that using your mortgage model. The monthly payment would be $2,844.08, consisting of $2,437.50 in interest and $406.58 in principal for the first month.\"\n\n**You:** \"What if we make it a 15-year loan instead?\"\n\n**Claude:** \"With a 15-year term, the monthly payment increases to $3,917.47, but you'll save $267,934 in total interest over the life of the loan.\"\n\n### Sales Pricing Assistant\n\n**You:** \"Claude, calculate pricing for 500 units for an enterprise customer in the EU region.\"\n\n**Claude:** \"Based on your pricing model:\n- Base price: €125,000\n- Enterprise discount (15%): -€18,750\n- Volume discount (500+ units): -€6,250\n- EU regional adjustment: +€3,125\n- Final price: €103,125\n\nThis includes all applicable discounts and regional pricing rules from your spreadsheet.\"\n\n### Investment Analysis Assistant\n\n**You:** \"Claude, analyze a portfolio with 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10% alternatives over 20 years.\"\n\n**Claude:** \"Using your portfolio model with current market assumptions:\n- Expected return: 7.8% annually\n- Risk (std dev): 12.3%\n- Probability of achieving 6%+ returns: 84%\n- Worst-case scenario (5th percentile): 2.1% annually\n- Best-case scenario (95th percentile): 13.5% annually\"\n\n## The 5-Minute Setup Guide\n\nLet's get Claude Desktop talking to your Excel files. Here's how:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Excel File (2 minutes)\n\nFirst, upload your Excel file to SpreadAPI and define which cells Claude can access:\n\n1. **Sign in** to [SpreadAPI](https://spreadapi.io)\n2. **Upload** your Excel file\n3. **Define the interface**:\n   - **Inputs**: Cells Claude can modify (e.g., loan amount, interest rate)\n   - **Outputs**: Results Claude can read (e.g., monthly payment, total interest)\n   - **Hidden**: Everything else (formulas, data, calculations)\n\n### Step 2: Generate Your MCP Token (1 minute)\n\n1. Click the **MCP Integration** button in SpreadAPI\n2. Click **Generate API Token**\n3. Name it \"Claude Desktop\" \n4. Select which services Claude can access\n5. Click **Generate** and copy your token\n\n### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop (2 minutes)\n\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. Go to **Claude → Settings** (Mac) or **File → Settings** (Windows)\n3. Click the **Developer** tab\n4. Click **Edit Config**\n5. Add this configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"spreadapi\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"spreadapi-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SPREADAPI_URL\": \"https://spreadapi.io/api/mcp/v1\",\n        \"SPREADAPI_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n6. Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token\n7. Save and restart Claude Desktop\n\n### That's It!\n\nClaude now has access to your Excel calculations. Try asking:\n- \"What spreadsheet calculations can you help me with?\"\n- \"List all available Excel services\"\n- Questions specific to your model\n\n## Advanced Integration Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Multi-Service Architecture\n\nOrganize complex Excel workbooks into focused services:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"services\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"loan-calculator\",\n      \"name\": \"Mortgage Calculator\",\n      \"description\": \"Calculate loan payments and amortization\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"investment-analyzer\",\n      \"name\": \"Portfolio Analyzer\",\n      \"description\": \"Analyze investment returns and risk\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"pricing-engine\",\n      \"name\": \"Dynamic Pricing\",\n      \"description\": \"Calculate customer-specific pricing\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Conversational Context\n\nHelp Claude maintain context across calculations:\n\n**You:** \"Compare mortgage options for a $500k home\"\n\n**Claude:** \"I'll analyze different mortgage options for a $500,000 home. Let me calculate several scenarios:\n\n1. 30-year fixed at 7.0%: $3,327/month\n2. 15-year fixed at 6.5%: $4,355/month\n3. 5/1 ARM at 6.0%: $2,998/month (initial)\n\nWhich option would you like to explore further?\"\n\n### Pattern 3: Batch Analysis\n\nProcess multiple scenarios efficiently:\n\n**You:** \"Analyze revenue impact if we reduce churn from 5% to 2%\"\n\n**Claude:** \"I'll calculate the revenue impact across different time periods:\n\n- Q1 2025: +$125,000 (+3.2%)\n- Q2 2025: +$287,000 (+7.1%)\n- Full Year 2025: +$1,450,000 (+8.9%)\n- 3-Year Impact: +$5,200,000 (+11.2%)\n\nThe compound effect becomes significant over time due to improved customer retention.\"\n\n## Security Deep Dive: How Your Data Stays Safe\n\n### The SpreadAPI Security Model\n\n```\n[Claude Desktop] <--MCP--> [SpreadAPI] <---> [Your Excel]\n      ↓                          ↓                    ↓\n  Sees only               Controls access      Stays private\n  results                 Enforces limits      Never exposed\n```\n\n### What Claude CAN Access:\n✅ Input values you explicitly allow\n✅ Output results from calculations\n✅ Service names and descriptions\n✅ Error messages if calculations fail\n\n### What Claude CANNOT Access:\n❌ Your Excel formulas\n❌ Cell references or structure\n❌ Hidden sheets or data\n❌ Macros or VBA code\n❌ File location or metadata\n❌ Other cells beyond defined interface\n\n### Security Features:\n\n1. **Token-Based Authentication**: Each token has specific permissions\n2. **Service Isolation**: Claude only sees services you explicitly share\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and controls costs\n4. **Audit Logging**: Track every calculation request\n5. **No Persistent Access**: Claude can't store or remember your data\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Issue: \"Claude can't find any tools\"\n\n**Solution**: Ensure you restarted Claude Desktop after adding the configuration.
