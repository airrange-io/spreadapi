OPTION A - User provides all values (FAST PATH - preferred):

   ‚Üí You have all values, just call it now!

OPTION B - Need parameter info (DISCOVERY PATH):
1. Call spreadapi_get_service_details("${serviceId}")
2. Show user what parameters are needed
3. Call spreadapi_calc("${serviceId}", inputs)

‚Ä¢ "42%" ‚Üí 0.42 (NOT 42)
‚Ä¢ "0.5%" ‚Üí 0.005 (NOT 0.5)

‚úÖ DO: Calculate immediately
Only ask permission for saving data or irreversible actions.

If calculation fails ‚Üí Auto-call get_service_details and retry
If result seems absurd (>$1M for typical inputs, scientific notation) ‚Üí Check percentage format, retry with correction`;

üí° Tips for Best Results:
‚Ä¢ Always provide ALL required parameters in each call (stateless)
‚Ä¢ Optional parameters have smart defaults applied automatically
‚Ä¢ Enum parameters accept numbered choices (1, 2, 3) or values
‚Ä¢ Percentages can be entered as decimals (0.42) or percentages (42%)
‚Ä¢ Boolean values accept multiple formats (true/false, yes/no, ja/nein)
‚Ä¢ For what-if scenarios, make multiple calls with different inputs (very fast!)
‚Ä¢ Check parameter constraints (min/max, allowed values) in the schema`;

  return `SpreadAPI: Spreadsheet Calculations as API Services

This server provides access to Excel/Google Sheets spreadsheets that have been published as calculation APIs. Think of them as powerful, stateless calculators where you provide inputs and get calculated outputs instantly.

üéØ Use Cases:
‚Ä¢ Financial calculations (taxes, insurance, loans, pricing)
‚Ä¢ Scientific formulas and engineering calculations
‚Ä¢ Business logic and data transformations
‚Ä¢ Complex multi-step computations

üìä How It Works:
1. Each service is a spreadsheet with defined input and output parameters
2. You provide values for the inputs (required + optional)
3. The spreadsheet calculates and returns the outputs in milliseconds
4. All validation (types, ranges, enums) is handled automatically

‚ö° Key Characteristics:
‚Ä¢ STATELESS: Each calculation is independent - always provide all parameters
‚Ä¢ FAST: Optimized calculations typically complete in <100ms
‚Ä¢ BATCH-CAPABLE: You can request multiple parameter combinations at once
‚Ä¢ NO MEMORY: Services don't remember previous calculations`;
