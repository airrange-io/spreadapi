## Enhanced MCP Response Example

### Before (Basic):
```
Service: Mortgage Calculator
ID: mortgage_calc_123
Description: Calculate monthly mortgage payments

INPUTS:
â€¢ interestRate - number [REQUIRED]
  Annual interest rate
  Range: * to *

OUTPUTS:
â€¢ monthlyPayment - number: Monthly payment amount
```

### After (Enhanced):
```
Service: Mortgage Calculator
ID: mortgage_calc_123
Description: Calculate monthly mortgage payments

WHEN TO USE:
Use when user wants to calculate monthly mortgage payments or compare loan terms

INPUTS:
â€¢ interestRate - number [REQUIRED] [PERCENTAGE: Enter as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%]
  Annual interest rate
  Examples: 0.05 (5% APR), 0.065 (6.5% APR), 0.07 (7% APR)
  Range: * to *

â€¢ loanAmount - number [REQUIRED]
  Total loan amount
  Examples: 300000 (for $300k loan), 450000 (for $450k loan)

OUTPUTS:
â€¢ monthlyPayment - number: Monthly payment amount
  Present as: Format as currency with 2 decimals

â€¢ totalInterest - number: Total interest paid over loan life
  Present as: Format as currency, emphasize if higher than principal
```

## UI Design

### Collapsed by Default
All AI fields are **optional** and **collapsed by default** to avoid overwhelming users.

### Visual Indicators
- ðŸ¤– Emoji prefix shows these are for AI
- "(Optional)" label makes it clear they're not required
- Helper text in gray explains the purpose

### Smart Placeholders
Each field has a detailed placeholder showing exactly what to enter:
- **Input Examples**: Shows format with context (e.g., "0.05 (5%)")
- **Output Hints**: Shows common patterns ("Format as currency")
- **Usage Guidance**: Shows conditional logic ("Use when user wants...")

---

## Data Storage

### Input/Output Parameters
Stored as part of inputs/outputs JSON array:
```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "interestRate",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Annual interest rate",
      "aiExamples": ["0.05 (5%)", "0.065 (6.5%)", "0.07 (7%)"]
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "monthlyPayment",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Monthly payment amount",
      "aiPresentationHint": "Format as currency with 2 decimals"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Service Configuration
Stored as top-level field:
```json
{
  "name": "Mortgage Calculator",
  "aiDescription": "...",
  "aiUsageGuidance": "Use when user wants to calculate mortgage payments",
  "aiUsageExamples": [...]
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **All fields are optional**
- Existing services work without changes
- New fields default to empty/undefined
- No breaking changes to API responses

âœ… **Graceful fallbacks**
- If no examples â†’ Just shows description
- If no hint â†’ Just shows output name/type
- If no guidance â†’ Uses existing aiDescription
