### 2.2 Cache Configuration

| Cache Layer | Storage | TTL | Size Limit | Invalidation |
|-------------|---------|-----|------------|--------------|
| **Result Cache** | Redis (JSON) | 15 min | Unlimited | On publish |
| **Process Cache** | Lambda Memory | 20 min | 1000 workbooks (~500MB) | LRU eviction |
| **Workbook Cache** | Redis (JSON) | 10 min | Unlimited | On publish |
| **Blob Storage** | Vercel Blob | Permanent | Unlimited | Manual |

### 2.3 Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Automatic Invalidation Triggers:**
1. Service publish/update → Clears all result + workbook caches for that service
2. Process cache → Auto-eviction via LRU when 1000 workbook limit reached
3. TTL expiration → Natural cache refresh

**Benefits:**
- Fresh data guaranteed after publish
- No stale calculation results
- Optimal balance between performance and data freshness

---

## 3. Performance Metrics

### 3.1 Observed Response Times (Production Data)

Based on real testing with the tax calculation service (abd48d0e-c3f2-4f6b-a032-1449fb35b5ab):

| Scenario | Response Time | Cache Layer | Frequency |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Same inputs (cached result)** | 5-10ms | L1: Result Cache | 30-40% |
| **Different inputs (cached workbook)** | 10-20ms | L2a: Process Cache | 30-40% |
| **Cross-instance (Redis)** | 30-50ms | L2b: Redis Cache | 10-15% |
| **Cold start** | 200-300ms | L3: Blob Storage | 5-10% |

### 3.2 Expected Performance by Traffic Pattern

#### High Cache Efficiency (Typical Production)
**Assumptions:**
- 40% result cache hits (repeated calculations)
- 40% process cache hits (same service, different inputs)
- 15% Redis cache hits (cross-instance)
- 5% cold starts

**Weighted Average Response Time:**
```
(0.40 × 7.5ms) + (0.40 × 15ms) + (0.15 × 40ms) + (0.05 × 250ms)
= 3ms + 6ms + 6ms + 12.5ms
= 27.5ms average
```

**Throughput per Lambda instance:** ~36 requests/second

#### Medium Cache Efficiency (Diverse Traffic)
**Assumptions:**
- 20% result cache hits
- 30% process cache hits
- 30% Redis cache hits
- 20% cold starts

**Weighted Average Response Time:**
```
(0.20 × 7.5ms) + (0.30 × 15ms) + (0.30 × 40ms) + (0.20 × 250ms)
= 1.5ms + 4.5ms + 12ms + 50ms
= 68ms average
```

**Throughput per Lambda instance:** ~14 requests/second

---

## 4. Scalability Analysis

### 4.1 Single Lambda Instance Capacity

| Cache Scenario | Avg Response | Requests/Second | Requests/Hour | Requests/Day |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **High cache (80%)** | 27.5ms | 36 | 129,600 | 3,110,400 |
| **Medium cache (50%)** | 68ms | 14 | 50,400 | 1,209,600 |
| **Low cache (20%)** | 160ms | 6 | 21,600 | 518,400 |

### 4.2 Multi-Instance Scaling (Per Region)

Vercel Pro can auto-scale to 100+ concurrent instances per region under load.

**Frankfurt (fra1) Region Capacity:**

| Cache Scenario | 10 Instances | 50 Instances | 100 Instances |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **High cache** | 360 req/s | 1,800 req/s | **3,600 req/s** |
| **Medium cache** | 140 req/s | 700 req/s | **1,400 req/s** |
| **Low cache** | 60 req/s | 300 req/s | **600 req/s** |

**Both Regions Combined (fra1 + iad1):**

| Cache Scenario | Total Capacity (100 instances/region) |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| **High cache (80%)** | **7,200 requests/second** |
| **Medium cache (50%)** | **2,800 requests/second** |
| **Low cache (20%)** | **1,200 requests/second** |

### 4.3 Sustained vs Peak Capacity

**Sustained Load (Recommended Operating Range):**
- **Optimal:** 2,000-3,000 requests/second (30-40% of peak capacity)
- **High load:** 3,000-5,000 requests/second (40-70% of peak capacity)
- **Peak burst:** 5,000-7,000 requests/second (short duration, <10 minutes)

**Why not run at 100% capacity?**
- Headroom for traffic spikes
- Lower latency during normal operations
- Cost optimization (fewer instances = lower bills)
- Better cache hit rates with fewer instances

---

## 5. User Capacity Estimates

### 5.1 Concurrent Users

**Assumptions:**
- Average user makes 1 API request every 30 seconds during active session
- Average session length: 10 minutes
- Mix of cached and uncached requests

**Concurrent User Capacity:**

| Requests/Second | Requests per User/Min | Concurrent Users |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 2,000 | 2 | **60,000 users** |
| 3,000 | 2 | **90,000 users** |
| 5,000 | 2 | **150,000 users** |

### 5.2 Daily Active Users (DAU)

**Assumptions:**
- Average user session: 10 minutes
- Users spread over 12 active hours per day
- Each user makes 20 API calls per session

**DAU Capacity:**

| Sustained Load | Sessions/Day | API Calls/Day | DAU Capacity |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 2,000 req/s | 864,000 | 17.2M | **430,000 DAU** |
| 3,000 req/s | 1,296,000 | 25.9M | **645,000 DAU** |
| 5,000 req/s | 2,160,000 | 43.2M | **1,080,000 DAU** |

### 5.3 Monthly Request Capacity

| Sustained Load | Requests/Hour | Requests/Day | Requests/Month |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **2,000 req/s** | 7.2M | 172.8M | **5.2 billion** |
| **3,000 req/s** | 10.8M | 259.2M | **7.8 billion** |
| **5,000 req/s** | 18M | 432M | **13 billion** |

## 6. Cost Projections

### 6.1 Vercel Pricing Model

**Pro Plan Base:** $20/user/month

**Function Execution Costs (Beyond Free Tier):**
- **Provisioned Memory:** $0.18 per GB-hour
- **Active CPU:** $0.60 per vCPU-hour (actual execution time)
- **Invocations:** $0.40 per million

**Included Free Tier (Pro Plan):**
- 1,000 GB-hours provisioned memory
- 400 vCPU-hours active CPU
- 1 million invocations

### 6.2 Cost per Million Requests

**At 80% cache hit rate (27.5ms avg response):**

```
Provisioned Memory per request:
  4GB × 0.0275s = 0.11 GB-seconds = 0.0000305 GB-hours

Active CPU per request (2 vCPUs):
  2 vCPU × 0.0275s × 0.8 (80% utilization) = 0.044 vCPU-seconds = 0.0000122 vCPU-hours

Cost per 1M requests (beyond free tier):
  Provisioned: 30.5 GB-hours × $0.18 = $5.49
  Active CPU: 12.2 vCPU-hours × $0.60 = $7.32
  Invocations: 1M × $0.0004 = $0.40

  Total: ~$13.21 per million requests
```

### 6.3 Monthly Cost Scenarios

| Monthly Requests | Free Tier Usage | Overage Cost | Total Monthly Cost* |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **1M** | Fully covered | $0 | **$20** (base only) |
| **10M** | 9M overage | ~$119 | **$139** |
| **50M** | 49M overage | ~$647 | **$667** |
| **100M** | 99M overage | ~$1,308 | **$1,328** |
| **500M** | 499M overage | ~$6,592 | **$6,612** |
| **1B** | 999M overage | ~$13,197 | **$13,217** |

*Assumes single user seat ($20/month base) + overage charges

### 6.4 Cost per User

**Example: 100,000 DAU making 20 calls/day each:**

```
Monthly requests: 100,000 × 20 × 30 = 60M requests
Monthly cost: ~$812
Cost per daily active user: $0.008/DAU/month
```

**Extremely cost-effective for SaaS pricing:**
- If charging $5/user/month → 625x ROI on infrastructure
- If charging $10/user/month → 1,250x ROI on infrastructure

---

## 7. Multi-Region Performance

### 7.1 Regional Distribution

**Frankfurt (fra1):**
- Primary for European traffic
- ~40-60% of global load (depending on user geography)
- Average latency to EU users: 20-50ms

**Washington DC (iad1):**
- Primary for North American traffic
- ~40-60% of global load
- Average latency to US users: 20-50ms

### 7.2 Cache Behavior Across Regions

**Process Cache:**
- ❌ **Not shared** between regions
- Each region builds its own cache
- Popular services cached in both regions independently

**Redis Cache (Result + Workbook):**
- ✅ **Shared globally** (if using Upstash Global or similar)
- First request in fra1 caches for iad1 users
- ~10-20ms added latency for cross-region Redis reads

**Blob Storage:**
- ✅ **Globally accessible**
- CDN-backed for faster global delivery
- ~100-200ms latency regardless of region

### 7.3 Traffic Routing Strategy

**Optimal Strategy:**
- European users → fra1 (primary), iad1 (failover)
- North American users → iad1 (primary), fra1 (failover)
- Global cache sharing via Redis reduces cold starts

**Expected Performance:**
- Regional users: 25-35ms average (high cache hits)
- Cross-region: +10-20ms for Redis cache reads
- Cold starts: Similar globally (~200-300ms)

## 8. Bottleneck Analysis

### 8.1 Current Bottlenecks (Ranked by Impact)

| Component | Current Status | Bottleneck Risk | Mitigation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Compute (vCPU)** | ✅ Excellent | Low | 2 vCPUs handle calculations fast |
| **Memory (4GB)** | ✅ Excellent | Very Low | Only 12% used for cache |
| **Redis latency** | ⚠️ Good | Medium | 30-50ms cross-region reads |
| **Blob storage** | ⚠️ Acceptable | Low | Only 5-10% of requests |
| **Network (regional)** | ✅ Excellent | Very Low | Two regions cover major markets |

### 8.2 Scale Limits

**Before hitting limits:**
1. **1,000 req/s:** Can run on 10-20 instances, excellent cache hits
2. **3,000 req/s:** Requires 40-60 instances, good cache hits
3. **7,000 req/s:** Requires 100+ instances, cache hit rate may drop
4. **10,000+ req/s:** Would need additional regions or Enterprise plan

**Recommended Operating Range:** 2,000-3,000 req/s sustained

---

## 9. Optimization Opportunities

### 9.1 Current Configuration (Good)

✅ Result cache: 15 minutes
✅ Workbook cache: 10 minutes
✅ Process cache: 1000 workbooks
✅ Auto-invalidation on publish
✅ Two regions
✅ Fluid Compute enabled

### 9.2 Potential Enhancements

**If cache hit rate drops below 60%:**

1. **Increase result cache TTL to 30 minutes**
   - Trade-off: Slightly older data, but 2x cache duration
   - Best for: Services with infrequent updates

2. **Expand process cache to 2,000-3,000 workbooks**
   - Memory available: 3.5GB unused headroom
   - Cost: Zero (already in RAM)
   - Benefit: Higher cache hit rate for diverse services

3. **Add Redis read replicas in both regions**
   - Reduces cross-region Redis latency
   - Cost: Additional Redis infrastructure
   - Benefit: 10-20ms latency reduction

4. **Pre-warm popular services**
   - Background job to load top 100 services into cache
   - Reduces cold starts for most users
   - Implementation: Scheduled function every 15 minutes

### 9.3 Not Recommended

❌ **Increase TTL beyond 30 minutes** → Risk of stale data
❌ **Remove result cache** → Performance would drop 80%
❌ **Reduce memory tier** → Would limit cache capacity
