# Redis Upgrade Summary - 1024 Connections

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Connection Limits** (`lib/redis-pool-config.js`)
- **Provider Limit**: 256 → **1024** connections
- **Reserved Connections**: 11 → **24** (for monitoring, admin, scripts)
- **Usable Connections**: 245 → **1000**

### 2. **Development Environment**
- **Max Connections**: 20 → **50** per worker
- **Max Waiting Clients**: 100 → **200**

### 3. **Production Environment**
- **Max Waiting Clients**: 1000 → **5000**
- **Per-Worker Connections**: Automatically calculated based on CPU cores
  - Example: 8 CPU cores = ~125 connections per worker
  - Example: 16 CPU cores = ~62 connections per worker

### 4. **Base Redis Client** (`lib/redis.js`)
- Added connection timeout: **10 seconds**
- Added keepAlive: **5 seconds**
- Increased command queue: **10,000** commands
- Added retry logic: **3 retries** per request

## Connection Distribution

With 1024 total connections:
```
Total Connections:     1024
Reserved:              -24
Available:             1000

Per Environment:
- Development:         50 connections per process
- Production (8 CPU):  125 connections per worker
- Production (16 CPU): 62 connections per worker
```

## Benefits

1. **4x More Capacity**: Handle 4x more concurrent requests
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced connection contention
3. **Higher Throughput**: More waiting clients allowed
4. **Improved Reliability**: More headroom for traffic spikes

## Monitoring

Check your connection usage:
```bash
# View pool stats
curl https://spreadapi.com/api/redis-pool-stats

# Monitor in Vercel logs
# Look for: "Redis Pool Configuration"
```

## Environment Variables (Optional)

You can fine-tune with these env vars:
```env
REDIS_POOL_MAX_PER_WORKER=100    # Override per-worker max
REDIS_POOL_ABSOLUTE_MAX=1000     # Override total max
REDIS_MAX_WAITING_CLIENTS=10000  # Override waiting queue
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** these changes
2. **Monitor** connection usage in production
3. **Adjust** if needed based on actual usage patterns

The system will now automatically utilize the increased connection capacity while maintaining safety margins!
